The poem begins with the speaker describing the event that the royal court, the king included, are attending. It is a fight between two lions and all are there to see it play out. The king himself, Francis, is a fan of this particular \\u201csport,\\u201d but his attention is split. He is amazed by the brutality of the fight and the fact that he is able to observe it from safety. On the other hand, he is distracted by the beauty of one for whom he \\u201csighs.\\u201d She is the lover of another lord. The lady herself is distracted by the valor of the king and decided to set a task for her lover. She drops her glove into the lion pit in the hopes that he will jump in and retrieve it for her. He does just this but is not pleased with her actions. He throws her glove in her face and leaves the arena. He does not believe that any true lover would set \\u201csuch a task.\\u201d\",\n          \"Quai de la Tournelle' by John Dos Passos is a poem about a lost love and how the sights and sounds of the Seine River in Paris bring that love to mind. The poem begins with the narrator looking out at the Seine River and describing the conflict he feels as it \\u201cswirl[s] away.\\u201d He describes it as being both \\u201cdark\\u201d and as \\u201cLaughing,\\u201d setting up the backdrop for the tumult of emotions that he will expound on. In an attempt to escape from the powerful emotions that hearing and seeing the river unearth, the speaker flees into his home. Bolting the door behind him, he ascends to his room where he hopes to find silence. Instead, an open window lets the sounds of the river into his room. It is at this point in the poem that the reader will come to understand that the narrator has lost a love of the utmost importance to him. He feels this loss intensely and is further reminded of it on the bank of the river. Additionally, as he looks below him to the street, it seems as if every passerby is in possession of a lilac flower (symbolizing love and youthful innocence, two things he has lost). The smell of the flowers has a similar impact on the speaker as the sound of the river. The poem concludes with the narrator relating his loss of love to the formation and dissipation of the smell of flowers and the rapidly running river. \",\n          \"\\u2018Sunny Prestatyn\\u2019 by Philip Larkin describes the destruction of a poster advertising an unattainable, seemingly perfect lifestyle. The poem begins with the speaker describing a poster advertising \\u201cPrestatyn,\\u201d a resort town in Wales. When the poster had only been up for a couple of weeks, those living in the area took it upon themselves to change it. The woman\\u2019s body was drawn on, and the sexual innuendoes present in the ad were enhanced. There was more than one participant in the defacing of the ad, making the whole series of events a protest of sorts against the idea that a perfect, pure, \\u201csunny\\u201d life is possible.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Lyrics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 301,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"King Francis was a hearty king, and loved a royal sport,\\nAnd one day as his lions fought, sat looking on the court;\\nThe nobles filled the benches, and the ladies in their pride,\\nAnd 'mongst them sat the Count de Lorge, with one for whom he sighed:\\nAnd truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show,\\nValour and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.\\nRamped and roared the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;\\nThey bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with their paws;\\nWith wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled on one another;\\nTill all the pit with sand and mane was in a thunderous smother;\\nThe bloody foam above the bars came whisking through the air;\\nSaid Francis then, \\\"Faith, gentlemen, we're better here than there.\\\"\\nDe Lorge's love o'erheard the King, a beauteous lively dame\\nWith smiling lips and sharp bright eyes, which always seemed the same;\\nShe thought, the Count my lover is brave as brave can be;\\nHe surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me;\\nKing, ladies, lovers, all look on;

Some read this as chronological narration of events, others as a “stream of consciousness” narration of past events that also includes more recent occurrences.   songs often elicit religious undertones that only strengthen the messages, without becoming consumed with biblical references. Sufjan told   that the correlation between his faith and his music exist because he believes faith does not influence us, rather it lives within us.    Casimir Pulaski Day is a holiday in Illinois that honors a Polish cavalry soldier in the American Revolutionary War.   The lyrics in the song show Steven’s serious questioning of his religion, however the music at the end of the song shows that this experience with death only brought Sufjan closer to God.  The song describes a friend, or a girlfriend, who died on Casimir Pulaski Day. In Illinois, if a loved one dies, you get the day off from work or school on said day, but since she died on a holiday, he has to suffer without a break.\n","\n","Generated Summary: In the first of a series of short stories, the author tells the story of a young boy who has been diagnosed with cancer.
