T5 Fine Tuning\n","\n","### This code implements a text summarization system using the T5 transformer model, specifically designed to summarize lyrics and poetry. It uses PyTorch Lightning for training infrastructure and includes several key components: a custom dataset class for handling lyrics/poetry data, a data module for managing data loading, and a model class that fine-tunes T5 for the summarization task. The system can process input text, generate summaries, and evaluate them using multiple metrics including ROUGE scores, BERT scores, content coverage, and semantic similarity. The code also includes functionality for loading different model configurations, training them with various hyperparameters (like learning rate and batch size), and saving the results. The evaluation process tests the model's ability to generate meaningful summaries of lyrics and poems, comparing them against human-written annotations to assess performance."],"metadata":{"id":"sSYnVInjvZP3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#
